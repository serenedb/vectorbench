/* The store: reducer + the URL round-trip, in one hook (searchbench's).

     - the URL is read once, before the first paint, so a shared link never
       flashes the default view;
     - it is written back after every committed state change, with
       `replaceState`, so the address bar always holds a link to what is on
       screen and the back button still leaves the product;
     - a link that pins a theme applies it through the platform toggle.

   `env` must be referentially stable — memoise it at the page. */
